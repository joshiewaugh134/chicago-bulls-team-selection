### Purpose of analysis

In the 2018-19 season, the Chicago Bulls placed 27th out of 30 in the NBA competition. An analysis has been conducted to determine the best starting 5 players that will play for the new season, based on a variety of statistics that were obtained in the 2018-19 season.

### Methods of analysis

The first step of analysis was to tidy the datasets, ensuring each variable was in a separate column, each observation was in a separate row, each value was in its own cell, and eliminating all missing data.

The second step was to determine the key metrics that are essential for each position. These were sourced from a basketball handbook (1), and further corroborated with a separate source (2). The findings were as followed:

1. Point Guard (PG) - Assists, Turnovers and Assist-to-Turnover Ratio
2. Shooting Guard (SG) - Assists, Rebounds and Scoring statistics
3. Small Forward (SF) - Rebounds, Assists and Scoring statistics
4. Power Forward (PF) - Rebounds per game and Scoring statistics
5. Centre (C) - Blocks, Rebounds and Scoring statistics

The third step was to filter the main data set according to players. and key metrics, narrowing down the dataset to the best performing players in these metrics, thus being the best in their positions. Prior to the filtering process, graphs were also created to determine the importance of these metrics in the data set, and identifying any trends through the data and positions.

The final step was to then determine which player was the top player, and then compare them to the players of that position in the top 5 teams in the 2018-19 season to compare their statistics.
