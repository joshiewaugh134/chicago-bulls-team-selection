### Purpose of analysis

In the 2018-19 season, the Chicago Bulls placed 27th out of 30 in the NBA competition. An analysis has been conducted to determine the best starting 5 players that will play for the new season, based on a variety of statistics that were obtained in the 2018-19 season.

### Methods of analysis

The first step of analysis was to tidy the datasets, ensuring each variable was in a separate column, each observation was in a separate row, each value was in its own cell, and eliminating all missing data.

The second step was to determine the key metrics that are essential for each position. These were sourced from a basketball handbook (1), and further corroborated with a separate source (2). The findings were as followed:

1. Point Guard (PG) - Assists, Turnovers and Assist-to-Turnover Ratio
2. Shooting Guard (SG) - Assists, Rebounds and Scoring statistics
3. Small Forward (SF) - Rebounds, Assists and Scoring statistics
4. Power Forward (PF) - Rebounds per game and Scoring statistics
5. Centre (C) - Blocks, Rebounds and Scoring statistics

The third step was to filter the main data set according to players. and key metrics, narrowing down the dataset to the best performing players in these metrics, thus being the best in their positions. 

Prior to the filtering process, graphs were also created to determine the importance of these metrics in the data set, and identifying any trends through the data and positions.

The final step was to then determine which player was the top player, and then compare them to the players of that position in the top 5 teams in the 2018-19 season to compare their statistics.

### Results of analysis

#### Point Guard

A graph was created to determine the relationship between `AST` and `TOV` variables. 

![Figure 1. Assists vs Turnover](figs/pg_data_ATTOVR_unfiltered.jpeg){width=450px}      

A clear relationship was determined showing that as one variable increases, so does the other. Another graph was then created once the filtering process was completed, leaving the top 9 point guards, to determine what their Assist-to-TUrnover Rate was in relation to their Salary.

Note: Monte Morris is top of the `Best_ATTOVR`, but the rate is only so high, due to having relatively few AST/TOV to other players. 
Note 2: Brandon Goodwin is only above Darren Collison due to his lack of game time across the season, skewing his results.

#### Shooting Guard

A graph was created to determine the break down of points per game and how they were scored, particularly their effectiveness of 3-Point Field Goals

![Figure 3. 3-Point Field Goals vs Points per Game](figs/sg_X3P_vs_PTSpg.jpeg){width=450px}

This graph shows that regardless of each players' accuracy, the points did not convert into high amount of points per game. Thus, the filtering system observed above average players for Field Goal Percentage, 3-Point Goal Percentage, and Points per game.

Further from this, players with above average scores for total rebounds was filtered, filtering the top 21 Shooting Guards of the league.

Finally, the value of these players was once again established by using the metric of `Salary/1000`. 

#### Small Forward

A graph showing the relationship between 3-Point Field Goals and the number of points scored during the game after the data set was filtered to only above average players in the assists category.

![Figure 4. 3-Point Field Goals vs Points over Season](figs/sf_PTS_vs_X3P.jpeg){width=450px}

The relationship in this graph identified that this variable doesn't accurately represent shooting values, due to the players falling on the lower side of the graph, suggesting that or Field Goals as a general variable is a better scoring indicator for this position. This filtering process narrowed the data set down to the Top 10 Small Forwards in the game. 

#### Power Forward

A graph showing the relationship between the number of rebounds per game and the number of games was created, as well as a graph that showed a relationship between 3-Point goals and Points scored over the season.

![Figure 5. Rebounds per game vs Games played throughout season](figs/pf_G_vs_RBpg.jpeg) {width=450px}

![Figure 6. 3-Point Field Goals vs Points over Season](figs/sf_PTS_vs_X3P.jpeg) {width=450px}

The rebounds graph indicated a trend that indicates that as more games are played, the rebounds per game also increases. Also, the trend for the Field Goals indicated the same trend as previous iterations, thus Field Goals as a general variable was used instead.

After filtering for above average players in this position, the top 16 players were identified for selection.

#### Centre

Finally, for the centre position, the metric of Field Goals over the season was used to identify key shooters in the centre position. Alongside this, Total Rebounds and Blocks over the season were used to filter the best centres, leaving the data set with just 6 players. 3 graphs were created to compare the 6 players, and determine the best suited candidate, with each variable being compared to number of games over the season

![Figure 7. Blocks per game vs Games played throughout season](figs/C_BLK_vs_G.jpeg) {width=450px}

![Figure 8. Rebounds per game vs Games played throughout season](figs/C_TRB_vs_G.jpeg) {width=450px}

![Figure 9. 2-Point Goal Percentage per game vs Games played throughout season](figs/C_X2Pp_vs_G.jpeg) {width=450px}

These graphs identified 3 potential players that had consistently good results in these metrics: `Steven Adams`, `Jarret Allen`, and `Hassan Whiteside`. The final step of this process were to compare these players results to their salary to determine which player is the best value for money, based on what statistics they bring to the team.
